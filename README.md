# trelliss-reviews
## This is a learning exercise. Components from this app may be added to the official Trelliss mobile app.
## The app is primarily created by following Net Ninja's YouTube tutorial "React Native Tutorial for Beginners."
## Starting with Tutorial #16 "Starting the Reviews App."
# The tutorial uses the previous version of React-Navigation which is substantially different from the current version.
## I temporarily paused development of this app. I will likely skip the Net Ninja Navigation tutorials #19-24 
## and rely on the official React-Native documents for guidance.
